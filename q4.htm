  <h1>Yet Another Blackjack</h1>
  <div id="question-body">
    <p>In this version of Blackjack, the player always deals three cards. When the button is clicked, the page should be
      updated replacing the three cards with three random cards facing up. The card images for each value/shape are
      inside 'images' folder. When player's hand (which is the sum of three cards' values) exceeds 21, the paragraph
      above button should show "You are Busted", otherwise it should show "You are Not Busted". The value of cards two
      through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten. To simplify
      this game, Ace is worth one. </p>
